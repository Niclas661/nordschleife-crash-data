Hohenrain
This section is tortuous but after passing it, you will reach the finish line.
Maintain a good speed. When you reach the last corner, hug the right wall as close as you can.
This section was added to the circuit to make drivers slow down at the pit lane entry. It also made the track 25m longer.
