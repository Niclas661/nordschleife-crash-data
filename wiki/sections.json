      "You will get a lot of speed in this area. Don't let the corners make you think differently: following the ideal racing line results in making barely noticeable turns.",
      "An uphill at the end of this section is however a risk for your car to lose control if you don't let go a little of the gas and start braking."
    ],
		"Hohenrain": [
      "This section is tortuous but after passing it, you will reach the finish line.",
      "Maintain a good speed. When you reach the last corner, hug the right wall as close as you can.",
      "This section was added to the circuit to make drivers slow down at the pit lane entry. It also made the track 25m longer."
    ],
    "Hatzenbach": [
      "The first half of this section is consisted of a few but hard corners and a couple straights. The second half is mostly corners which will keep you at a cruising speed.",
      "Be careful not to go too fast entering the second half, you might end up in the grass!"
    ],
    "Flugplatz": [
      "Cars go flying here if they don't slow down. That's why it's called the Flugplatz."

    "Schwedenkreuz": [
      "You can gain some real speed before approaching the Schwedenkreuz.",
      "It's easy here to slid off the road if you approach it too fast. It does look good enough of a curve to not brake, but looks can be deceiving..."

      "A smooth right turn corner to a straight uphill. You better beware: you're approaching Flugplatz..."

    "Hocheichen": [
      "This sharp right turn can be tricky to follow the ideal racing line, but a late apex is my recommendation."
    ],
    "Aremberg": [
      "Possibly one of the slower corners on this map: most cars do well in second gear in this corner. Too fast and you'll end up in the sand."
    ],
    "Adenauer-Forst": [
      "Maintain a good speed here, and these corners will be history. But it can be tricky to find the racing line here and find the appropriate speed. Practice makes perfect, right?",
      "After passing the corners, pedal to the metal and get ready for Metzgesfeld."

    "Metzgesfeld": [
      "Spectators stand here and take pictures of cars that crash here.",

      "The corners are smooth and tilted, but it's easy to underestimate how fast you can go in this section."
    ],
    "Wehrseifen": [
      "Almost a 90-degree corner, you will go real slow in this corner before you can put the pedal to the metal."
    ],
    "Exmühle": [
      "One of the more trickier corners on this track and requires a good braking distance, even for the best-performing cars.",

    "Bergwerk": [
      "Only one somewhat sharp corner, which can be tricky to tell which speed you should be in, in an otherwise relaxing section with small up- and downhills."
    ],
    "Kesselchen": [
      "The first corner can feel unsafe and make you want to brake, but you can do well by simply letting go of the gas for a tenth of a second."
    ],
    "Klostertal": [
      "The second corner of this section is on an uphill which obstructs vision of the road ahead. Let go of the gas here or at least apply minimal brake to maintain control of your car here, as you can go flying if you don't regulate that speed!"
    ],
    "Karusell": [
      "One of the more known corners of this track, which will have you going around a half-circle-shaped angled road."
    ],
    "Hohe Acht": [
      "Smooth corners but keep an eye on your speed: come in too hot and you'll end up in the grass on the right."
    ],
    "Wippermann": [
      "A downhill that will gain you some extra speed. Slow down a bit before the corner and position the car on the left after the corner."
    ],
    "Eschbach": [
      "A somewhat sharp entrance to another downhill very similar to Wippermann."
